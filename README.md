# Hi there, I am Chris ðŸ‘‹

## About

Previously, I was a research associate at LanzaTech, a bio-recycling technology aiming to convert waste carbon emissions to sustainable chemical products. 
There, I leveraged data science in synthetic biology and continuous fermentation data.
I developed an interest in machine learning techniques to optimize protein sequences for various synthetic biology projects. 

In university, I studied biophysics and worked in Heather Wheeler's lab at Loyola University at Chicago, where I used machine learning methods in human genomics.
